6'1, 280lb with back problems. Flew Premium Economy on AC's new 787. Seats were great - wide enough, with lots of space for legs and a legrest. AVOD system is new and fast, but somewhat annoying - trailers appear in the movies menu, and sometimes it's difficult to understand if you're offered a film or just a trailer for one....
